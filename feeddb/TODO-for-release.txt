Thoughts on improvements needed in order to make a public release. 

=== Pre-population with initial data ===

Even though can be argued optional, these are desirable in a start-up database: 
  - User groups: contributors, terminologists, with proper permissions to access data types
  - Values in controlled vocabularies (except for, perhaps, taxa) 
  
=== Package as django apps === 

It would be neat to package the project as one or more Django apps, so that it could be installed 
similar to any other Django app, like admin or south. 

=== Port to the current Django version === 

We are developing under 1.1, the current is 1.2.3 (released May 2010) 
The 1.3 release is scheduled 2011-01-17
