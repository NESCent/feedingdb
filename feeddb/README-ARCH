Various "architectural" implementation notes that are worth knowing upfront, 
rather than finding in code comments. 

=== Special SYSTEM user ===

SYSTEM was created by feed data migration 0043, in or after SVN 3649. 
It is intended to be used in data migrations that create new records, 
to fill the "created_by" fields. 

=== Restrictions on Admin's cascaded delete ===

Purpose: Deletion of a term from a CV should not (even with a user confirmation!) lead to deletion 
of associated data objects that have this term in a non-null field.  In other words, a term deletion 
should be permitted only when the term has been replaced by an alternative in all data objects. 

See feed/models.py, the CRITICAL_ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS array. 
TODO: Xianhua, could you explain more how to use this mechanism?
