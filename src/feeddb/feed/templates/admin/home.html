This database collects physiologic data and associated metadata for a number of mammalian species. 
The data contain information on muscle activity, bone and muscle strain, jaw and oropharyngeal apparatus motion, 
and intra-oral pressure and were generated using several techniques (e.g., electromyography, cineradiography, sonomicrometry). </p>

The purpose of collecting data of this type is to address fundamental questions about the evolution, functional morphology, 
physiology and development of the mammalian head. The data are searchable and can be downloaded into csv format. </p>
 <!--
<p>Feeding, critical to survival, is an integrated function involving 
numerous craniofacial structures. 
Changes in these structures are a significant part of the evolution and 
diversification of mammals. 
Our understanding of mammalian craniofacial evolution rests, in part, on
 functional studies of the motor patterns of craniofacial 
muscles during feeding, and of the movements and forces within the 
feeding apparatus. A number of researchers have collected 
large data sets of motor patterns of feeding muscles and the associated 
movements and forces from the jaws and hyolaryngeal apparatus. 
Such data address fundamental questions about the evolution, functional 
morphology, and development of the mammalian head. Despite 
significant datasets and collegiality amongst workers, inter-specific 
studies of neuromotor evolution are rare because of the lack of a master
 database. </p>
 <p>FEED was developed with three specific aims:
 <img style="float:left;margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 25px;height: 180px;" src="{% app_static_prefix %}images/alpaca_open_mouth.jpg" " />
<ul>
<li> combine existing EMG, kinematic, and bone strain data for at least 36 mammalian species in 10 orders into a database; </li>
<li> generate operational strategies for studying key scientific 
questions about neuromotor evolution and constraint, craniofacial 
evolution, and feeding behavior with the database; </li>
<li> test hypotheses about the evolution and conservation of motor pattern in mammals. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This will be the first major database of neuromuscular data to be 
constructed. It will be a significant tool for studying the evolution of
 the mammalian feeding apparatus, 
and will be a model for future studies of the evolution of functional 
systems and neuromotor evolution.

This site is currently only accessible for the working group members. If you want to see how the system works, please visit our demo site, 
which includes an example dataset, representing a subset of the actual database, as well as a live version of the graphical user interface.
