# Feeding Experiments End-user Database (FEED)

The [Feeding Experiments End-user Database](http://www.feedexp.org/) (FEED) was developed by the [Mammalian Feeding Working Group at NESCent](http://nescent.org/science/awards_summary.php?id=150) to permit synthetic, evolutionary analyses of the physiology of mammalian feeding. FEED manages raw physiologic data linked to extensive metadata, including EMG, kinematic, and bone strain recordings.
