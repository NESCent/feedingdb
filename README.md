# Feeding Experiments End-user Database (FEED)

The [Feeding Experiments End-user Database](http://www.feedexp.org/)
(FEED) was first developed by the [Mammalian Feeding Working Group] at
NESCent to permit synthetic, evolutionary analyses of the physiology
of mammalian feeding. FEED manages raw physiologic data linked to
extensive metadata, including EMG, kinematic, and bone strain
recordings.

The successor version (FEED v2) was developed with support by NSF awards
DBI-1062333 and DBI-1444582 to Christine Wall (Duke University). Full
credits are available from the database website (click "About").
